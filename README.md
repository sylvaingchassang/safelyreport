## Build locally
Run the following command to generate HTML pages in the `_site/` directory:

```
For further options, see [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).

## Build for production

## Directory structure
Text sections can be found in Markdown files under `_sections/` and will be automatically generated by Jekyll, no need to modify `~/index.html` when adding new sections.
The front matter in each Markdown file follows this format:
```
title: <title>
order: <number>
short_name: <id for the corresponding <section> block in the generated index.html>
```
Images and downloads are stored in the `assets/` folder.
Header, footer, navigation, and other non-body elements are stored in the `_includes/` folder.
