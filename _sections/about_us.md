Professors Boudreau and Chassang, respectively of Columbia Business School and Princeton University, are experts on the transmission of sensitive information in organizations. In their empirical work, they have studied the reporting of labor safety violations and sexual harassment in garment factories, as well as the effectiveness of different reporting protocols in generating actionable data. They believe that lessons learned from high-stakes contexts can help keep workplaces safe during the COVID-19 pandemic by getting workers to report potential COVID-19 exposure in a timely manner.
