We have developed three practical solutions to implement a COVID-19 exposure survey along the lines described above and in Boudreau and Chassang (2020). Both instructions and implementation materials for these solutions are provided under the [GNU Copy Left License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). Also see our [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below.
<!-- TODO: how to make the disclaimer link a page-scroll? -->

The three solutions are:
- Purely computer-based solution: Best suited for organizations with IT support whose employees have reliable access to the internet.
- Mixed computer-paper solution: Best suited for organizations with some IT support and whose employees need not have reliable access to the internet.
- Purely paper-based solution: Best suited for organizations with limited IT support and whose employees need not have reliable access to the internet.

We provide detailed instructions and supporting materials to implement these solutions.
