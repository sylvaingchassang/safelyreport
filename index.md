## Encouraging Workers to Self-Report Exposition to COVID19
#### June 29, 2020

As the economy reopens, employers are striving to adopt policies and practices that protect their employees from [contracting COVID19](https://hbr.org/2020/05/5-tips-for-safely-reopening-your-office), particularly as infections [continue to surge](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/28/coronavirus-live-updates-us/) in many states. Data suggests that promptly [managing COVID19 cases](https://hbr.org/2020/03/your-employee-tested-positive-for-covid-19-what-do-you-do) is [extremely valuable](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/us/coronavirus-distancing-deaths.html). Unfortunately, suppressing outbreaks early is challenging because hard-to-identify pre- symptomatic patients are contagious. Ideally, employees would pro-actively report being at risk – because they, or someone in their immediate environment, is experiencing early symptoms – as soon as they suspect they may have been exposed. However, employees may not want to reveal that they are a contagion risk. In spite of [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/reducing-stigma.html) and [WHO](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/a-guide-to-preventing-and-addressing-social-stigma-associated-with-covid-19) guidelines on reducing [stigma](https://hbr.org/2020/04/dont-let-fear-of-covid-19-turn-into-stigma), reports of discrimination against [COVID19 survivors](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-18/fear-and-stigma-around-coronavirus-deliver-harm-and-control) and [frontline workers](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31191-0/fulltext) abound.

In order to limit the spread of COVID19 in workplaces, managers must ensure that employees are comfortable disclosing their risk. A potential solution, is to implement “random rotation” policies in the workplace. In this approach, all workers are regularly [surveyed](https://www.mayoclinic.org/covid-19-self-assessment-tool) about their COVID19 exposure and symptoms. Based on survey responses, a minimum share of employees, say between 5 and 10%, is systematically rotated out of the workplace for a week. Employees rotated out include all employees reporting COVID19 exposure as well as a randomly-selected group of employees who do not. At the end of the week, returning employees are [tested for symptoms](TODO: no link in the HBR pdf?). Symptomatic or COVID19-positive employees receive appropriate medical care.

Random rotation ensures that workers who report exposure maintain plausible deniability vis à vis coworkers and direct managers. An employee being sent home can plausibly argue that he or she was unwillingly randomly-selected. Through this channel, workers concerned that they may be sick can safely ask to temporarily isolate. The cost of random rotation is that some employees will be sent home even if they don’t ask to be. This is a calculated cost. The fact that healthy people can be rotated out of work is the reason it is safe to self-report exposure.

### A proven methodology

Random rotation builds on “randomized response” survey methods that have been used by social scientists to collect sensitive data for decades. The key idea, introduced by [Warner (1965)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1965.10480775), is plausible deniability. Surveys must be designed so that any sensitive answer can attributed to random shocks in the survey procedure. This allows respondents to plausibly deny having submitted a sensitive answer regardless of the recorded response.

For instance, a researcher seeking to estimate [illicit drug use among athletes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871609003202) may give survey respondents a deck of cards bearing different questions: 20 cards bear the question “Do you use performance enhancing drugs?” and 10 of cards bear the instruction “There is no question. Just answer YES.” Each athlete shuffles the deck and privately draws a card. If an athlete answers “YES,” the researcher cannot infer whether the athlete uses drugs or is complying with the survey protocol.

[Cross validation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12205) studies comparing responses to randomized response surveys with direct measures find that they can significantly increase truthful reporting. Using randomized response in organizational settings is a [more recent idea](https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/86/6/2530/5265253). [Laboratory evidence](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25918) shows that plausible deniability improves whistleblowing, even under threat of retaliation.

Outside of social science research, protecting sources is a familiar concern for military and law enforcement agencies. Part of the value of random “[cordon and search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordon_and_search)” counter-insurgency operations used in Afghanistan and Iraq is to allow military forces to act on information while protecting their sources.

### How to implement random rotation

We provide [several templates](https://www.sylvainchassang.org/assets/papers/random_rotation_implementation_tools.zip) implementing random rotation using spreadsheets and paper ballots. They can be used directly by in-house HR departments. Alternatively, third party survey firms may be contracted to collect workers’ self-reports, produce a list of workers to be rotated out each week, and submit this list to HR without disclosing individual responses.

A key input of random rotation is the minimum share of the workforce sent home in order to protect the identities of potentially-exposed employees. A plausible starting point would be to rotate between 5 and 10% of the workforce and survey workers on whether they feel comfortable enough to report exposure. The minimum share of employees sent home may be adjusted depending on employees’ responses.

An important complement of random rotation [is a paid sick-leave or work-from-home program](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html) that limits the potential financial losses from being rotated out of the workplace (the [Families First Act](https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/democrats.appropriations.house.gov/files/Families%20First%20summary.pdf) supports subsidizes sick leave polices for small and medium enterprises). This is especially important for [economically vulnerable employees](https://hbr.org/2020/04/what-will-u-s-labor-protections-look-like-after-coronavirus). If managers are concerned that employees are abusing the system and systematically asking to be rotated out, the number of leaves per worker could be to 2 or 3 per semester.
           
Finally, random rotation is more useful the more employees know about their contagion risk. For this reason, organizations should encourage employees to participate in [contact tracing](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1000961/launching-mittr-covid-tracing-tracker/) programs.

### Is random rotation right for your organization?

Whether random rotation is right for your organization depends on its ease of implementation and the magnitude of health benefits it brings.

Random rotation is particularly easy to implement in workplaces that are not functioning at full capacity or have work-from-home programs. In these cases, the opportunity cost of sending a healthy employee home is low. In addition, implementing a random rotation policy expresses a commitment to public health that may help employees manage their [rentry anxiety](https://hbr.org/2020/06/help-your-employees-manage-their-reentry-anxiety).

Potential health benefits are high if employees are at high risk of COVID19 exposure or if employees are economically vulnerable. Meatpacking plants are a good example. Close working conditions and cold temperatures facilitate contagion. Economically vulnerable workers, aware of high unemployment rates, may fear losing their job if they bring up potential illness.

Ultimately, it may be appropriate to tailor random rotation policies to individual work units. Economically vulnerable frontline employees may need a higher minimum rate of rotation to feel comfortable reporting they are a contagion risk.

### Addressing stigma more broadly

Finally, the methods described here can be used to elicit sensitive information beyond COVID19 exposure. [Mental health issues](https://hbr.org/2019/10/research-people-want-their-employers-to-talk-about-mental-health), [burn out](https://hbr.org/2020/04/3-tips-to-avoid-wfh-burnout), and [harassment](https://hbr.org/2018/05/why-its-so-hard-to-speak-up-against-a-toxic-culture) are major threats to employee well-being that often go [unreported because of fear of stigma](https://hbr.org/2019/02/5-ways-bosses-can-reduce-the-stigma-of-mental-health-at-work). All of them have been made worse by the pandemic, confinement, and job insecurity. Investing in survey methods that ensure plausible deniability can help get information out and target support to the people who need it.
