## SOLUTIONS

We have developed three practical solutions to implement a COVID-19 exposure survey along the lines described above and in Boudreau and Chassang (2020). Both instructions and implementation materials for these solutions are provided under the [GNU Copy Left License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). Also see our [disclaimer](TODO) below.

The three survey solutions are:
A purely computer-based solution that demands a basic understanding of spread-sheets and mailmerge, but is very scalable, and does not require compliance from employees to provide protection from stigma. This solution is best suited for organizations with IT support whose employees have reliable access to the internet.
A mixed computer-paper solution that demands a basic understanding of only spreadsheets. It does not require compliance from employees to provide protection from stigma. This solution is best suited for organizations with some IT support, but whose employees need not have reliable access to the internet.
A purely paper-based solution that requires no computers, is easy to implement, but requires some compliance from employees to provide protection from stigma. This solution is best adapted for organizations with limited IT support, whose employees need not have reliable access to the internet.

We provide detailed instructions and supporting materials to implement these solutions.
